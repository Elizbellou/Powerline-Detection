# Powerline-Detection
This repo contains two files, one with YOLOv5 models  and one with YOLACT- based models, all of them trained on a powerline dataset with 3 object classes, i.e. towers, conductors and insulators. You can use any model as a baseline to do transfer learning on your projects, related to powerline inspection tasks.
